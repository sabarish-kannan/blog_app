Tools and Technologies: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

Project Solution Approach: The first step in this project is to set up a new FastAPI project using your preferred
Python environment. Next, you will create a Task model using SQLAlchemy and define the columns for the task ID,
task name, task description, and completion status. Create a new SQLAlchemy session and connect to the SQLite database.
You will then implement authentication and authorization mechanisms such as OAuth2 or JWT to secure the API. Test the API
using tools such as Postman or FastAPI TestClient.
